## RevAI

RevAI is a small full-stack project that provides an AI-powered code review endpoint (Backend) and a React + Vite frontend to send code for review and display the results.

This repository is split into two main folders:

- `Backend/` — Express.js server that talks to Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to generate code reviews.
- `Frontend/` — React app (Vite) with a simple UI to submit code and view the AI review.

## Features

- POST endpoint to request a code review for a block of code.
- Uses `@google/generative-ai` (Gemini) via a server-side service.
- Simple React frontend with syntax highlighting and preview.

## Repo structure

- `Backend/`
	- `package.json` — backend dependencies and scripts
	- `server.js` — bootstraps the Express server
	- `src/` — backend source
		- `app.js` — express app, routes
		- `routes/ai.routes.js` — AI routes
		- `controllers/ai.controller.js` — request handling
		- `services/ai.service.js` — wrapper around the Google Generative AI client

- `Frontend/`
	- `package.json` — frontend dependencies and scripts (Vite + React)
	- `src/` — React source (App.jsx, main.jsx, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) and npm installed.
- A Google Generative AI API key (Gemini) — this project expects it in an environment variable.

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `Backend/` folder (same level as `server.js`) with the following:

```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

The backend reads `process.env.GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY` to authenticate with the Google Generative AI client.

## Running the project (development)

Open two terminals, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

Backend (from `Backend/` folder):

PowerShell example:

```powershell
cd Backend
# Start with node
node server.js

# Or, if you have nodemon installed globally/dev, run (live reload):
npx nodemon server.js
```

Notes: `server.js` starts the app on port `3000` by default and exposes the API at `http://localhost:3000/ai`.

Frontend (from `Frontend/` folder):

```powershell
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will start the frontend dev server (usually on `http://localhost:5173/`). The frontend sends requests to the backend endpoint `/ai/get-review`.

## API

POST /ai/get-review

Description: Receive an AI-generated code review for the supplied code.

Request body (JSON):

```json
{
	"code": "/* your source code as a string */"
}
```

Response: Plain text review generated by the model.

Example (PowerShell using curl):

```powershell
$body = @{ code = Get-Content -Raw -Path './example.js' }
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/ai/get-review' -ContentType 'application/json' -Body ($body | ConvertTo-Json)
```

Or with curl:

```powershell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"code":"console.log(\"hello\");"}' http://localhost:3000/ai/get-review
```

## Development notes

- The backend service file `Backend/src/services/ai.service.js` expects `process.env.GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY`.
- The service currently selects the `gemini-2.0-flash` model and includes a system instruction tailored for code review.
- The backend exposes a simple `/` route that returns `Hello World` (useful for smoke tests).

## Next steps / ideas

- Add input validation and more robust error handling on the backend.
- Add authentication / rate limiting for the API.
- Add unit/integration tests for controller and service logic.
